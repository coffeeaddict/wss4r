= 1. What is it (and what is it not)
  WSS4R (Web Service Security For Ruby) is a library that implements some of the 
  standards for web service security defined by the oasis open consortium [1].
  It is a proof of concept (or "Can i do it with ruby?") and not an fully featured
  implementation, so it's focussed on the encryption and signature aspects of 
  web services. WSS4R sits on top of the famous soap4r library of NAKAMURA Hiroshi [2],
  so implementing servers or clients that uses data encryption or signatures is easy
  when you know how to use soap4r. 
  Besides that there is a integration into the rails [3] application server, so you
  can use the features of WSS4R in rails driven web services.
  
  I've tested WSS4R with the following counterparts:
     - Web Service Enhancements 2.0 [8]
	  - Java Web Service Development Pack 2.0 [9]

	  
  WSS4R is my first ruby project, so it is not very ruby like in most places nor is it
  a example of good ruby programming in general. It was started mostly to learn ruby, 
  not to implement an full featured WS-Security conform library.
  
  If you like it or hate it or want more features, drop me an email at Roland.Schmitt@web.de.
	  
  
= 2. Requirements
	- Ruby [4] with compiled bindings to openssl [6]  
	     (tested with Ruby 1.8.5 and 1.8.6)
	
	Optional (for the examples):
	- Rails [3]
	     (tested with version 1.0.0)
	- Sqlite3-Ruby [7]
        (tested with version 1.1.0)
		  
= 3. Installation
	Simply do 
	   
	    ruby setup.rb
		 
		 
= 4. Usage
	To use WSS4R, one have to require the new driver class
   
	   require "wss4r/rpc/driver"
		
	instead of 
		require "soap/rpc/driver"
	
		
= 4.1. Resolver
	Resolver objects are used to find certificates, keys and to authenticate users. 
	Resolver objects know how to get the corresponding private key for a certificate or how to load
	a certificate identified by a name.
	For example, when a client sends a encrypted request to the server, there is only the certificate 
	embedded in the message. A resolver object is responsible for loading the private key of the 
	certificate.
	
	There two implementations of resolvers:
	   - CertificateDirectoryResolver
		  Loads keys/certificates from files in a specified directory in the file system. 
		  
	   - DatabaseResolver
		  Loads keys/certificates from sqlite3 databases.
		  
	
= 4.2. UsernameToken		
	   Example: 
		
		...
		driver = Driver.new('http://localhost:8070/','urn:multiply')
		driver.add_method('multiply','a','b')
      ...
		usernametoken = UsernameToken.new("username", "password")
		driver.security().add_security_token(usernametoken)		
		...
		
	The client is authenticated with his username and password. The password is not sended as clear
	text, instead a hash function is used.
	
	
= 4.3. Encryption
	    Example:
		 
		 ...
		 resolver = CertificateDirectoryResolver.new("../certs/ca")
		 certificate = resolver.certificate_by_subject("/C=DE/ST=Rheinland-Pfalz/L=Trier/O=FF/OU=Development/CN=Server/emailAddress=server@web.de")
		 x509 = X509SecurityToken.new(certificate)
		 enc_data = EncryptedData.new(x509)
		 driver.security().add_security_token(enc_data)
		 ...
		 
	The soap body is encrypted with the TripleDES algorithm.  The used encryption key is then 
	encrypted with the certificates public key and placed in the soap header.
	
	Actually only TripleDES and AES are supported by WSS4R as encryption algorithms. To use AES instead of the default
	TripleDES, set:
	   enc_data.sessionkey_algorithm=Types::ALGORITHM_AES_CBC (for 256 bit encryption) or
	   enc_data.sessionkey_algorithm=Types::ALGORITHM_AES128_CBC (for 128 bit encryption)
		 
= 4.4. Signature
       Example:
		 
		 ...
		 sign_cert = OpenSSL::X509::Certificate.new(File.read("../certs/wse/wse-client.cer"))
		 pkey = OpenSSL::PKey::RSA.new(File.read("../certs/wse/wse-client.key"))
		 x509 = X509SecurityToken.new(sign_cert, pkey)
		 signature = Signature.new(x509)
		 driver.security().add_security_token(signature)
	    ...
	
	The soap body and the soap header timestamp elements are signed with the supplied certificate. The signature
	is embedded in the soap header.

	
= 4.5. Signature/Encryption
       Example:
		 
		 ...
 		 resolver = CertificateDirectoryResolver.new("../certs/wse")
		 driver.security().add_security_resolver(resolver)
		 sign_cert = OpenSSL::X509::Certificate.new(File.read("../certs/wse/wse-client.cer"))
		 pkey = OpenSSL::PKey::RSA.new(File.read("../certs/wse/wse-client.key"))
		 x509 = X509SecurityToken.new(sign_cert, pkey)
		 signature = Signature.new(x509)
		 driver.security().add_security_token(signature)
       encrypt_cert = OpenSSL::X509::Certificate.new(File.read("../certs/wse/wse-server.cer"))
		 x509 = X509SecurityToken.new(encrypt_cert)
		 enc_data = EncryptedData.new(x509)
		 enc_data.sessionkey_algorithm=(Types::ALGORITHM_AES_CBC)
		 driver.security().add_security_token(enc_data)
		 ...
		
   You can combine signature and encryption. In most cases, for encryption the clients certificate is used and
	for signature the certificate of the server.
	If you first apply the encryption, the signature is generated over the encrypted data. When signing is the first step, the
	the signature is generated from the plain content. So it is important to know which token is first added to the driver object.


= 4.6. Interoperability with WSE 2.0
   Should work with usernames, encryption and signatures.
	Sample Visual Studio projects are provided in examples/WebServiceTest (client) and examples/WebService (server).
	
	
= 4.7. Interoperability with JWSDP 2.0
	Should work with usernames, encryption and signatures.
	Per default the examples the JWSDP works with keyIdendifiers for finding certificates and keys. 
	WSS4R does not support the keyIdentifier mechanism to identify certificates, because it is not defined by oasis group.
	
	
= 4.8. Integration into rails	
   To use WSS4R in rails one have to modify the controller that implements the web service:
	
	require "wss4r/aws/utils"
	require "activerecordresolver"

	class SimpleServiceController < ApplicationController
	   wsdl_service_name 'SimpleService'
      web_service_scaffold :invoke
      web_service_api SimpleServiceApi
  
      wss_add_resolvers([ActiveRecordResolver.new()])
		
		
	I've only tested the direct dispatching mode of action web service with WSS4R.

= 5.1. A simple example
	At the command line, go to examples/server and type:
	
	   ruby TestServer.rb user
		
	A WebRick server starts that requires a username/password from the client, where the password is the username reversed.
	In another shell, change the working dir to examples/clients and type:
	
	  ruby TestWSS4R.rb user
	  
	It show the result of the multiplication of the 2 arguments. The client uses "Ron" as username and "noR" as password. Setting
	the password to other values than "noR" in the TestWSS4R.rb file results in a "User not authenticatd!" message.
	
	Stop the TestServer with CTRL-Z (or CTRL-C). Restart it with
	
	  ruby TestServer.rb enc sign
	  
	The server now will first encrypt any request, then signing it.
	
	Start the client by typing:
	
	  ruby TestClient.rb sign enc
	  
	The client first signs the request, then encrypts it and shows the response. 
	
	You can use various monitoring tools like the tcpmon utility from the axis project [10] to view the 
	resulting request/response messages.
	
= 5.2. Rails example
  Go to examples/rails/simple and type
  
    ruby script/server
	 
  To start the client, open a new shell and go to examples/rails/simple/client.
  
    ruby client.rb
	 
  The output shows the reversed string that the client sents to the server. The client signs his request and the server encrypts
  and signs the response.
